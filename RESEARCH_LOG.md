# Research Log

> Every meaningful decision in `iterate` starts with research. This file is the citation trail.

> Public. Recruiters reading the repo see literature awareness, not vibes.

## Why this file matters

When someone opens this repo, this file shows:

- We don't code by intuition — every architectural decision has a paper or post backing it
- We considered multiple approaches and chose with rationale
- The project is research engineering, not tutorial walkthrough

This is the "papers → citations" pattern that separates research engineers from people who follow LangChain tutorials.
